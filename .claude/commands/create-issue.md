Analyze and create new github issue based on the description: $ARGUMENTS.

Follow these steps:

# PLAN
1. Understand the description provided in the $ARGUMENTS
2. Think harder on the description to assess if the issue is related to other issues
- Search in the issue ISSUETRACKER.md file so that you can identify any related issues
- If related issues are found add them to the issue description as related issues
3. Ask for clarifying questions about the description
4. Think harder to analyze the responses and identify potential conflicts with the issue

# CREATE
- Describe the issue that will be created to the user
- Confirm if the issue is to be created before creating the issue
- Create the new github issue

Remember to use the GitHub CLI ('gh') for all GitHub-related tasks
